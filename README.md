# **Guardian-IO**

### **Empowering Ethical, Transparent, and Sustainable Supply Chains**

Guardian-IO is a comprehensive platform designed to promote ethical, transparent, and sustainable practices in global supply chains. Using cutting-edge technology like **blockchain**, **AI-powered analytics**, and **real-time collaboration tools**, Guardian-IO enables businesses, NGOs, and governments to work together in building ethical supply chains that comply with **human rights**, **environmental standards**, and **corporate social responsibility (CSR)** goals.

## **Key Features**
1. **Supply Chain Transparency**: Track the origin and production of materials and products using **blockchain** for full transparency.
2. **Labour Rights Compliance**: Ensure compliance with **international labor laws** and **human rights** regulations through **risk assessments** and **audits**.
3. **Sustainability Metrics**: Evaluate and improve the environmental impact of your supply chain with **life cycle assessments** and **sustainability audits**.
4. **Ethical Sourcing**: Use **AI-driven recommendations** to choose suppliers that meet ethical standards, reducing risk across the supply chain.
5. **Anti-Forced Labour Compliance**: Monitor and ensure compliance with laws like the **Modern Slavery Act**, preventing forced and child labor.
6. **Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)**: Track and report on **CSR initiatives**, enhancing stakeholder trust.
7. **ESG Reporting**: Generate and manage **Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG)** reports that align with investor expectations.
8. **Global Collaboration**: Collaborate with businesses, governments, and NGOs to tackle global issues such as **human trafficking**, **climate change**, and **labor exploitation**.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
